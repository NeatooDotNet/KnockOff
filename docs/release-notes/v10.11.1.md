# v10.11.1 - BCL Interface Compatibility Improvements

**Release Date:** 2026-01-09

## Bug Fixes

- Deduplicate inherited interface members to prevent duplicate interceptor classes
- Add `new` keyword for interceptor properties that hide `object` members (Equals, GetHashCode, ToString)
- Standalone stubs now walk inherited interfaces to generate all required implementations

## Details

Initial fixes for BCL interface compatibility. See [v10.12.0](v10.12.0.md) for complete BCL interface support including asymmetric nullability handling.
